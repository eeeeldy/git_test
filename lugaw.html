   <h1>Lugaw With Egg</h1>
   <img src="images/lugaw.jpg" alt="">
   <div class="desc">
       <p>Lugaw is a comforting Filipino rice porridge (similar to congee) typically served for breakfast or during the colder months. Many Filipinos have their own version of lugaw, but this is the one that I grew up eating.<br>
       
      In my opinion, lugaw is the perfect cozy meal for a snowy day in. To serve, I like adding a hardboiled egg, garlic chips, scallions, and a squeeze of lime for added flavour. You could also add a drizzle of chili oil if you like.

           <li>
                Add a drizzle of oil to a large pot, then sauté chopped onions, half of the sliced garlic, and ginger (optional) until soft. Cook over medium-high heat.
           </li>   
           <li>
                Add the rinsed rice, salt, annatto powder, and water. Stir everything together, then cover and let simmer for 50-60 minutes until thick. Be sure to stir every 15 minutes to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
           </li> 
           <li>
                While the lugaw is cooking, heat a drizzle of neutral oil in a frying pan over medium heat and fry the rest of the sliced garlic until golden brown. Keep an eye on the garlic to prevent it from burning. 
           </li>
            <li>
                Once garlic is golden, transfer into a small bowl and season with a pinch of salt.
           </li>
            <li>
                Taste the lugaw and adjust the seasoning as needed, then add ground black pepper to taste. 
           </li>
            <li>
                Ladle a few scoops of lugaw into a bowl, then add a sliced hardboiled egg, garlic chips, chopped scallions, and a squeeze of lime juice on top. 
           </li>
